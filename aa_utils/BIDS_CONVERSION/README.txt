This directory contains utilities and files that demonstrate
conversion of DICOM data (as provided by CNDA) to BIDS format.

The file CNDA_2_BIDS.rtf describes the process in gory detail
-- a simpler approach is probably just to have a look at the
example script BIDS_convert.m and modify it as needed
(see also the helper files included in example_helper_files).

You'll either have to copy the mfiles in this folder to somewhere
on your Matlab path, or add this folder to your Matlab path,
or just work with this folder as your current working directory.
